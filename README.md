# Customer-Churn-Prediction

A data science/analysis project on inference and prediction of customer churn data for a telecommunications company using R.

## Problem Description

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors.  
Inference goal: to help them understand what kind of customers are leaving and propose a retention plan to decrease churn and improve revenues.  
Prediction goal: to build a predictive model with high prediction accuracy. 

## Data 
Data can be found [here](https://zhang-datasets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/telcoChurn.csv) on the cloud. Downloaded data is the Credit.csv file.

## My Solution
I implemented a generalized linear regression for the inference task to identify significant attributes that affect cutomer churn rate. Using the insights generated, I came up with a detailed retention plan.  
For the churn rate prediction, I created training and testing data split for prediction accuracy evaluation. Then I deployed a deep learning model, a deep neural network, to predict churn rate.

## Executing program
Simply download the data and the code and run the R code.
